  <Description>[H3]D-4S Projection Platform[h3]
[P]After the success of the D-4, Icnom realized that the large generator necessary for the shield system could be used to power other devices. This craft is marketed as a way to keep building facades "intact" while under repairs, but many underworld elements quickly realized that a portable, large-scale hologram could be used to mask illicit activities.</Description>
